- 👋 Hi, I’m @Jebus1332
- 👀 I’m interested training llm, improving models performance with NLP, finding efficient workflows & <3 learning evolving tech and existing tech, mapping and learning the un-explored domain of quantuam vectors,tri-lensing photo-con ent LLM, Qubit based encryption.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to be human ... The beginning of light and the spinor factors of inductive capacity. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... Inventions, App for the furute of everything automation.

- ⚡ Fun fact: ...UNIVERSAL VICAR POLICY AO-SYS
- Efficiency Formula Example:
[scss]  :Optimize the workflow by calculating time, energy consumption, token cost (for NLP models), and accuracy to achieve maximum output with minimal input.
Begin Questo to enlightenment.
Strategy: Achieve a 5+ Dimensional thought process that seemlessly intigrated into a data matrix with adaptive focus on ecouragment with positive feedback. 
Efficiency Metrics: Implement an algorithm that evaluates:
Time/Accuracy Trade-off: Use probabilistic models like Bayesian Inference to weigh the time it takes to make a decision versus the accuracy of the outcome.

Energy Usage: Assess the computational cost of running deep learning models and web scrapers, and optimize the infrastructure to lower the cost and time of operation (e.g., cloud computing optimization with autoscaling).

Token Cost: For systems like GPT-4 or BERT, track the token usage per query/operation. Use this to manage costs efficiently when generating NLP outputs.

Improved Engineering would be merit based allocation of memory, bandwidth allocation/informative engadgement w/ llm training and proficiency at determinging value of input as a contribution to the training of the model; effort/intent=outcome.

Efficiency Formula Example:
Copy code *category for Alternate communication methods and increasing Nuero network stability w/ RHIC Limbics & AAC NLP Effect. Perception^understanding [steps to sentience] 
Productivity=Efficiency = (Time_saved / Accuracy) / (Cost of Energy + Token Usage + Time spent)
