Automating Bias Detection with Machine Learning, first set up vector map and make a script function like a basic polynomial and add an adaptive chart to integrate into a UI to visualize and flag accuracy and reliability margin.
Next, weâ€™ll train a simple model to detect bias in articles based on text data. This uses scikit-learn and Naive Bayes.

4.1 Bias Detection Script
Create another script (e.g., bias_detection.py) and copy the following code:

python
Copy code
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer
from sklearn.naive_bayes import MultinomialNB
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score

# Sample dataset (replace with actual data)
data = [
    {"text": "This candidate is the best!", "label": "biased"},
    {"text": "The policy focuses on economic growth.", "label": "unbiased"},
    # Add more examples
]

# Preparing data
texts = [d['text'] for d in data]
labels = [d['label'] for d in data]

# Convert text to feature vectors
vectorizer = TfidfVectorizer()
X = vectorizer.fit_transform(texts)
y = labels

# Split data into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.3, random_state=42)

# Train a simple Naive Bayes classifier
model = MultinomialNB()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Predict on the test set
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)
print(f"Accuracy: {accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)}")
4.2 Run the Bias Detection Script
Save the file and run it in the terminal, similar to the previous example:
bash
Copy code
python bias_detection.py
